# DaVinci

This is an open source quiz game, based off of Leonardo Da Vinci's inventions. It was the 'creative piece' for an 8th grade Social Studies project. It is programmed in 100% Javascript, and uses no other dependencies (Other than Bootstrap, but that is just for the stylesheet).
You are free to download, alter, and learn from the project. You can also repurpose it if you like, I couldn't care less.
